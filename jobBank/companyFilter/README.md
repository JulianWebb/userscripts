# CompanyFilter

This userscript was developed to allow users to filter results on the Canadian Job Bank from specific companies. It adds a button to every search result allowing quick filtering and saves the list to the client's localstorage for persistence. There is currently no way to unfilter companies other than to delete/modify the localstorage entry `companyFilter`.
